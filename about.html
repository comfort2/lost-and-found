     <h1>MISSION</h1>
     <p>Lost and Found is a support scheme to keep the world going. Technology is advancing and people need to change in other to move at the same pace with Technology. People loose valuable thing along when interracting with the world without trace. When I find such item, when you find such item, when we find such item, when they find such item, what do we do? Since we are not motivated to report such items, we offen discard them. When you go to banks, you find a whooping lot of Identification Cards missing. The main mission of this project is  to create a world where you can retrieve your lost items including money. People might think, who will ever return money if found? It has ever happened and it will again because there is an easy medium to address lost and found issues.</p>
